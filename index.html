            <p>Automoblox is a brand name of a wooden car construction toy designed by Patrick Calello and produced by Automoblox Company, LLC of Cranford, New Jersey. The toy consists of wooden car body sections with patented plastic interconnects, polycarbonate wheels and rubber tires, plastic passengers and polycarbonate screens. Each car can be disassembled into its component parts and re-assembled, parts from different cars can be combined to let children design their own models. Automoblox wooden cars retain all of the warmth and character of traditional wooden cars, the European Birch wood is light and modern with a lovely warm grain. Automoblox lines are sleek and organic and reflect the styling of modern cars but brightly coloured plastic highlights and trim mean they are fresh and exciting enough to appeal to modern children.
