            <p>The A9 concept would be positioned higher than Audi's current flagship model, the A8, and is aimed at other top-end luxury saloons like the Porsche Panamera, and if it ever went into production, the Lamborghini Estoque. The styling of the A9 concept was partially inspired by the stunning architectural style of Santiago Calatrava's buildings in "La Ciudad de las Artes y de las Ciencias" (The City of Arts and Sciences) in Garcia's hometown of Valencia. This influence can be seen in the clean flowing lines of the vehicle and futuristic styling features. Calatrava's buildings look like they come from 100 years in the future, and so does this. The single-piece windscreen and roof is formed from an as-yet undiscovered nanotechnology material which features an automatic-system for repairing damage, and it can also be adjusted for color and opacity.
